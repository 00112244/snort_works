# Snort IDS/IPS Projects
![Snort-Projects](snort.svg)

This repository contains a collection of practical projects focused on using **Snort** as an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) for monitoring network traffic, detecting threats, and preventing malicious activities. Each project simulates real-world use cases relevant to SOC operations, intrusion detection, and incident response.

---

## Purpose

* Demonstrate the use of Snort for analyzing and detecting suspicious network traffic.
* Showcase Snort in both IDS (detection) and IPS (prevention) modes.
* Apply custom Snort rules for identifying malicious patterns and activities.
* Provide reproducible steps for building a hands-on IDS/IPS lab environment.

**Key Features:**
* Deployment of Snort in IPS mode using NFQUEUE.
* Creation and tuning of custom blocking rules.
* Real-time prevention of malicious packets and attacks.
* Logging and verification of blocked events.
**Highlights:**
* Successfully blocked port scans, pings, and SQL injection attempts.
* Showcased packet dropping and active defense capabilities.
* Practical demonstration of Snortâ€™s use as a prevention tool in SOC environments.

### 3. Detecting Nmap Scans with Snort
**Description:** Demonstrates how to configure Snort to detect various Nmap reconnaissance scans, including SYN, XMAS, NULL, and UDP scans, providing early visibility into network probing activity.
**Key Features:**
* Writing and tuning custom Snort rules for Nmap scan detection.
* Real-time alerting on reconnaissance attempts.
* Log collection and analysis for investigating suspicious scanning activity.
* Verification of detection using controlled lab tests.
**Highlights:**
* Successfully detected SYN, XMAS, NULL, and UDP scans.
* Showcased effective thresholding and rule tuning to reduce false positives.
* Provided foundational SOC skills for network reconnaissance detection.

### 4. SQL Injection Detection with Snort
**Description:** Demonstrates how to configure Snort to detect SQL injection (SQLi) attacks on web applications by inspecting HTTP requests and generating alerts for malicious payloads.
**Key Features:**
* Writing and tuning custom Snort rules for SQL injection detection.
* Real-time alerting on HTTP-based attack attempts.
* Log collection and analysis for investigating web application threats.
* Verification of detections using controlled lab tests with tools like sqlmap.
**Highlights:**
* Successfully detected common SQL injection techniques (tautology, UNION SELECT, comment injection).
* Showcased effective rule tuning to reduce false positives.
* Provided practical SOC skills for web application security monitoring.
